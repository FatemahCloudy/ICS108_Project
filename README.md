Event Booking System

Project Overview:

The Event Booking System is a Java application designed to facilitate booking events like 
conferences, concerts, seminars, workshops, and more. The system aims to provide users with a 
user-friendly platform to browse upcoming events and book tickets.

Key Features:
- The system has two scenes: admin scene, and user scene.
- The admin can perform event management: add, edit, and delete events.
- Events include details such as title, category, description, date, time, location and capacity 
(number of available ticket)
- Users can browse upcoming events and view event details.
- Users can select events and book tickets based on available slots.
- Users can book multiple tickets at once.

Minimum Requirements:
- Classes for Event, Ticket and User.
- At least two scenes: admin and user.
- The user scene should show events title, location, date, time and available ticket.
- Past events (with date older than current day) should be either excluded from the view 
entirely, or if shown in the program, the user must not be able to book them.
- The admin should be able to create, delete and edit events in the admin scene.

Submission:

The deadline for the project will be the last week of the term, details will be announced later.
